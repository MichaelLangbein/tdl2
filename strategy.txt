Strategy:

 1. the only class that should have state (i.e. the task tree) is the controller
 2. no view should be allowed to edit the task tree. 
   Instead, it sends a request to the controller to update the tree 
   and then fetches fresh data from the controller
   
   
To achieve this:
 
interface Task
    get*

class MutableTask
    get*
    set*
    
Controller gets MutableTask tree, 
but gives to views only Task tree.



3. Controller has no direct influence on views, only notifies them about changes in model.


To achieve this: 
all view-setters are private and only called from 'receiveMessage'
