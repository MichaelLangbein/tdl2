## Process

### 1. Content & Feeling

1.  What information do we want to convey?
    1. Design: how to best convey that information
2. How should the user feel about that information?
    1. Art direction
3. Who is the recipient?
4. Call to action: a simple way to act upon the desired info & feeling

#### 1.1. Information design
How to convey information
- intro
- info
- call to action

##### Hierarchy of graphical dimensions
- Categorical
1. position
2. size
3. color
4. texture

##### Marks & channels
This is about how to visualize attribute types: categorical, ordered, quantitative.

Using:

 - Marks: Point, line, area
 - Channels: Position, color, size

Typically, a row in your csv is a mark, and a column is a channel.


#### 2.1. Art direction
How to make somebody feel

- Are there any colors you don't like?
- Is there a corporate design?
