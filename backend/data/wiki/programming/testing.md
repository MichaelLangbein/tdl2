# Tactics

-   TDD
    -   Write tests before coding
-   BDD
    -   Write user behavior, expect UI to respond correctly

# Selenium

# Cypress

# Playwright

-   Formally puppeteer (back then by google, now microsoft)
-   playwright has a test-recorder: https://testingbot.com/support/playwright/recorder.html#introduction

# Comparing selenium, cypress and playwright

|                               technology | WebDriver (less versatile than CDP) | electron app with embedded browser, uses CDP only for starting browser, after that testcode directly injected into browser's js-loop (app-code in one iframe, test-code in another iframe) | your script runs in node, which talks to browser via CDP   |
|                       scripting language | python, java, js, ruby              | js, ts                                                                                                                                                                                     | python, java, js, ts                                       |
|                                 browsers | all                                 | all except IE and Safari                                                                                                                                                                   | all except IE, but also mobile                             |
| waiting, preventing "flakiness" in SPA's | waiting has a few caveats           | nice                                                                                                                                                                                       | nice                                                       |
