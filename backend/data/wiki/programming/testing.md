# Tactics

-   TDD
    -   Write tests before coding
-   BDD
    -   Write user behavior, expect UI to respond correctly

# Selenium

# Cypress

# Playwright

-   Formally puppeteer (back then by google, now microsoft)
-   playwright has a test-recorder: https://testingbot.com/support/playwright/recorder.html#introduction
-   `npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org`

## Cucumber

-   Implements a language called "Gherkin": "given that ... / when I do ... / then I should get ..."
-   running a cucumber file returns the code snippets required to create the `given`, `when` and `then` implementations
-   since this chops our scenarios into smaller parts, we can re-assemble some of those parts if we want, saving us some coding.
    -   we can save even more coding by adding cucumber-variables to the cucumber file, which will take on all possible values that we provide.

# Comparing selenium, cypress and playwright

# Storybook

-   The UI component explorer. Develop, document, & test for React, Vue, Angular, Ember, Web Components, & more!


# JMeter

## Setup

- plugins
  - download
  - copy contained jar into jmeter/lib or jmeter/lib/ext

## components
  - thread-group = users
    - request
      - observer
    - timer
    - http-cookie-manager
  - HTTPS test-script recorder
  

## cli
- `jmeter.bat -n -t .\my_script.jmx -l .\my_log.jtl -e -o .\my_dashboard`

## Recorder

HTTPS test-script recorder
    - target controller: HTTPS test-script recorder
    - browser: configure to use JMeter's proxy
    - browser: point it to JMeter's TLS-certificate

Alternative:
- Chrome BlazeMeter plugin -> exports recording straight to a jmx


After recording:
- at root request, click "retrieve all embedded resources". 
- copy-paste requests from recorder into thread-group
