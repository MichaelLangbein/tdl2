# Tactics

-   TDD
    -   Write tests before coding
-   BDD
    -   Write user behavior, expect UI to respond as expected

# Selenium

-   Very much like cypress

# Cypress

-   Runs app in a container
-   Backends:
    -   Uses Mocha by default
    -   Can use Cucumber

# Playwright

-   Formally puppeteer
-   Nodejs
-   playwright has a test-recorder: https://testingbot.com/support/playwright/recorder.html#introduction

# Storybook

-   The UI component explorer. Develop, document, & test for React, Vue, Angular, Ember, Web Components, & more!
