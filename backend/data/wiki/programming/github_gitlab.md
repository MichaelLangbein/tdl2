- Experiments
  - 0. Base case: create project, invite one user
    - Result 1: Guest-user can't see invitation to project, nor visit repo
    - Result 2: Guest-user _can_ go directly to the project-url under https://github.com/users/MichaelLangbein/projects/1
    - Result 3: Guest-user can see items in project, but not those that are issues of the repo
      - But not to the repo
      - This is probably because the repo is private.
      - Seems I can invite users directly to the repo, though, under `repo/settings/access/collaborators`
- My strategy
  - 1 base-repo (private, only me)
  - 1 client-repo (private) per client which is a fork of the base repo
  - adding client users either directly to the client-repo or to an organization
  - Verify:
    - create private fork of wp-demo
      - for me to host a fork, I must add it to a new org, otherwise github will complain that I already have a copy
- Strategy 2.0
  - 1 base-repo (private, only me)
  - 1 org per client (stadtwerke-ffb)
    - is this org private or publicly visible?
      - org is publicly visible, but repos and projects are not (if they are each private)
  - 1 fork of base-repo into stadtwerke-ffb org
    - in repo settings, activate issues
  - add project to client-org
  - add users to client-org
    - as members
    - send them direct link to organization, because they probably haven't gotten a note on their github dashboard (but probably _did_ get an invitation mail)
    - not necessary to explicitly give users read-access to forked repo or write access to projects, they automatically have those rights
      - if users have right to fork repo, they can write to repo

## Experiments

**Experiment 1**: many projects on one repo.
I don't want different clients to see each other.

- crete one repo
- make two organizations
- org1: link repo and project1 and guest-user1
- org2: link repo and project2 and guest-user2
- Can guest-user1 see guest-user2? <-- Nope
- Can guest-user1 see project2? <-- Nope
- Can guest-user1 and guest-user2 see the actual repo? <-- Jup

## Agile on GitHub

- scrum is a brand of agile (though it does proceed agile)
