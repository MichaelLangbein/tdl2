# Plasmic.app

A typical workflow looks like this:

Developer first sets up Headless API integration in the codebase. This involves initializing Plasmic with the appropriate project ID and public API tokens, and designating areas in your application where Plasmic content should show up.
Content editors, designers, marketers, or developers can build designs and pages in Plasmic studio. Once the designs are ready, they can publish the designs.
The next time your application is built for static site generation, or rendered by the server or the client, the new published designs will show up in your application.
