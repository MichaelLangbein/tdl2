## Concepts

-   **Event**
-   **Command**: called from ui, returns no results. Can be async.
-   **Operation**: called from ui, returns result. Can be async.
-   `app.json`: dependency injection configuration
-   `layout.xml`: like root component
    -   is a xml file instead of jsx so that users can customize without coding?
    -   also to allow live reloading?
