# Stock market

## Lingo
- Paying a premium: willing to pay at a high price

## Long term
Only long-term trends are predictable.
Here you have cycles.
For long term gains I have ETF's.

## Mid-term: value vs growth strategies
Two common mid-term strategies:

- Value investing:
    - Invest in companies that are better than their stock-price; await price correction
    - Mature, even declining companies - companies that are currently but temporarily) out of favor
    - Slow, Warren Buffet

- Growth investing: 
    - Invest in companies that grow faster than rest of market
    - Often > 20% over some years
    - Tend to be small and young companies
        - Exception: Microsoft and amazon both grew > 20%
    - Fast

### P/E Multiple
P/E Multiple = Stock-price [\$/share] / Companies-earnings-per-share [\$/share] = price/winnings


Example:
Value investor finds bagel-shop trading at a PEM = 5x.
Other bagel-shops trade at PEM = 10x.
Investor verifies that the company is just as good as the others.
Cons:
- Might only deliver gains many years in future
- Might get you to buy lots of bad companies

Example: 
Growth investor finds a startup trading at PEM = 30x.
(Or even N/A because startup doesn't have earnings yet.)
Can redeem quickly.
Investor is even willing to accept a higher volatility.
High risk and high reward.
Cons:
- Even if a company still grows, but does so less than expected, the premium might not have been worth it.
