# Sales


## Control the sale

To have control, you must be perceived as
- sharp
- enthusiastic
- expert
... i.e. you can help them achieve their goal.
Then people will be willing to listen to you.

Otherwise the prospect takes control from you.

## Build trust

- Do the simple things really well.

## Believe in what you sell
