## Theory 

Keynsian:
- A government should run deficits during recessions â€” when tax revenues are low and government spending is high as a result of the working of fiscal stabilizers such as unemployment subsidies
German ordoliberalism:
- Also liberal. Wants to create maximum space for the market. Supply-side oriented. Anti-inflation. Shuns large government spending.

Green & SPD tend to be a bit more Keynsian than ordoliberal.


## Eurobonds
Greece needs money. 
It can issue government bonds that private investors can buy.
Those investors then give Greece money but expect
    - some interest every month,
    - as well as the initial value at the end of some years
in return.

Since Greece is not considered very reliable, investors demand a high interest-rate for Greek bonds.

Euro-bonds would be backed by other european countries. 
Interest rates depend on all european countries, not on the recipient (Greece) alone.
But if the recipient fails to pay back it's interest, the other european countries would jump in.

- pro:
  - Greece can get loans easier. Can use these for anti-cyclical investment.
  - Can get those loans fast.
- con:
  - Other countries carry the risk if Greece fails to pay back.
    - Encourages Greece to take on debt for doubtful investments. Other countries cannot influence what the money is being used for.
  - Other countries get loans harder.

Instead, currently Europe has the stability fonds.
- Greece borrows money from that fond
- In response needs to let troika into the country.

- pro:
  - EU has control over how funds are spent
- con:
  - only happens really late, when economy is already tanked.


If eurobonds were to happen, then no EU country would issue its own state-bonds any more.
Instead there would be a new EU institution issuing the EU-bonds.
At the beginning of every month, all EU countries would get together to state how many bonds they want to give out.
That new institution could control that those loans don't exceed the Maastricht criteria.

## Euro
Con:
    - A country with high debt cannot print money
      - Does increase inflation
      - But removes the debt
Pro:
    - No costs for currency exchange.
    - Investors are not afraid that country could inflate currency making their investment worthless.

## Greek debt crisis
- In crisis 2008, Germany steered EU to bail out banks, but impose austerity on Greece.
  - While Greek unemployment is recovering, its GDP is still as low as 2008

Why was there no:
- Relief package?
  - Merkel seems to not be a Keynsian. Instead wants to see Greek economy based on its own market, not on government projects.
- Eurobonds?
  - Same reason. EU wants to make sure that it has control over how Greece spends its money.


## Ireland and special economic zones
Ireland had a special economic zone on Shannon Airport in the 50s, which brought in industry into an agricultural land.
When Ireland joined the EU, the SEZ was no longer permitted, instead Ireland switched to a very-low income tax model - which worked, too.
Ireland was very vulnerable to the crisis in 2008, but recovered ok.


## Eastern Europe
Romania has great growth in GDP. Good it- and automotive-industry. Important trade-route.
Most important trade partner is Germany (at least one good use of the German car-industry).
There is a lot of direct foreign investment.

But a lot of the countries hinterland is left behind. (Especially the north)
Chances are that this is where many of the expat-prostitutes come from. 
The government is considered fairly corrupt. Many institutions still have their Soviet personal.


## Agrarian subsidies
They suck.
