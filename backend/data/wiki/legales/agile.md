    - Use case
        - Epics
            - User stories


# SCRUM
An implementation of agile.

## Workflow
Circle of 1-2 weeks:
-> Product backlog
-> Sprint planning
    - pick user stories
    - estimate task time
-> Sprint backlog/kanban board
-> Sprint with daily
-> Potential product
-> Sprint review
    - how to improve next time

## Roles
- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Team members

## Lingo
- **Backlog** (evolves and changes priority with every sprint)
    - **User stories**
        - As a *___* I need *___* so that *___*
        - priority
        - definition of done
        - *No* technical details
        - should take about one sprint
        - note: gitlab doesnt have stories, uses epics instead
    - **Epics** (optional): sometimes, you have a really large user story, that should be broken down into several ones.
        - could take months and multiple sprints
        - has a rough time-frame
        - not all user stories must belong to an epic.
- tasks/issues: actual development step
- milestones (optional): a temporal marker.
    - not a deliverable, but a unit of time
    - often used inside one epic to split it into phases (then an epic has several milestones)
    - or used to align several stories (or epics) with another (then a milestone has several stories/epics)
