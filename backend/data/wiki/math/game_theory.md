# Game theory

## Aspect 1: How to design systems such that the participants' interests are aligned with the system-designer's
Racket-teams deliberately loose to face weaker opponents in the future. This does not align with the tournament-designer's objective of ordering the teams by strength.


## Aspect 2: When does egoistic behavior of participants produce optimal results in the system
Sometimes it does not. Example: Braess's paradox.
In Stuttgart, a fast road was closed - removing an optimal route that everyone took.
This forced drivers to pick one of two alternative routes - each longer than the original.
BUT: there were now two equally bad routes - wich each only got half as congested.
In effect, traffic got faster.

### Selfish routing and the price of anarchy

## Aspect 3: When/how do we reach equilibria?



## Stable marriage
- Men get the best possible outcome
- Women get the worst possible outcome
- Men cannot get a better outcome by collaborating
- Women can get a better outcome by collaborating
