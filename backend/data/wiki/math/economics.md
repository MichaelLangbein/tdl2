## Value, consumer-surplus and demand

- $v(q)$: **marginal value**, i.e. $\frac{\partial \text{happyness}}{\partial q}$
- $cs(q) | p$: **consumer surplus**, defined as $cs(q) | p = \int^{q}v d q - pq$
- $\frac{\partial cs}{\partial q_0} = 0 \to v(q_0) = p$
- $q_0 = v^{-1}(p)$, we call $v^{-1}(p)$ the **demand** $q^{demand}(p)$.


Corollaries
- Increase in usefulness of any one unit: curve moves up
- More units demanded: curve moves right


Special cases:
- *Normal* goods: higher income leads to higher demand
- *Inferior* goods: higher income doesn't lead to higher demand
- *Complementary* goods: higher consumption of *A* leads to higher demand for *B*
    - Example: use of computers increases demand for printers.
- *Substitute* goods
    - Example: cola and pepsi

## Cost, producer-surplus (aka. profit) and supply

- $c(q)$: **marginal costs**, i.e. $\frac{\partial \text{total production costs}}{\partial q}$
- $ps(q) | p$: **producer surplus**, aka. profit, defined as $ps(q) | p = pq - \int^{q}c d q$
- $\frac{\partial ps}{\partial q_0} = 0 \to  p = c(q_0)$
- $c^{-1}(p) = q_0$, we call $c^{-1}$ the **supply** $q^{supply}(p)$.


## Markets

In a free market, we have $p: q^{supply}(p) = q^{demand}(p)$

> *Proof*: By contradiction

>> *Case 1*: assume that $p: q^{supply}(p) < q^{demand}(p)$
>>
>> This is a market of shortage. $q$ is determined by the producers: producers will be able to produce a quantity such that their producer-surplus is maximal ... whereas the consumer-surplus might not be.
>>

>
>> *Case 2*: assume that $p: q^{supply}(p) > q^{demand}(p)$
>>



In a free market, the market-equilibrium is where *social welfare* (consumer- plus producer-surplus) is maximized.
