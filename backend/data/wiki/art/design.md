- Especially their faces
- Outisde of people, contrast, edges etc. do have an impact
- Loomis' suggested paths of entry and exit seem to not hold up.

# Process

## 1. Content & Feeling

1.  What information do we want to convey?
    1. Design: how to best convey that information
2.  How should the user feel about that information?
    1. Art direction
3.  Who is the recipient?
4.  Call to action: a simple way to act upon the desired info & feeling

### 1.1. Information design

How to convey information

- intro
- info
- call to action

##### Hierarchy of graphical dimensions

- Categorical

1. position
2. size
3. color
4. texture

##### Marks & channels

This is about how to visualize attribute types: categorical, ordered, quantitative.

Using:

- Marks are things to be displayed:
  - Numbers, key-value pairs, ...
- Channels are properties of those marks:
  - Position, shape, color, size, opacity, texture, tooltips, ...

Typically, a row in your csv is a mark, and a column is a channel.

### 2.1. Art direction

How to make somebody feel

- Are there any colors you don't like?
- Is there a corporate design?
- Mood-board

Google fonts most similar to the above:

- Serif:
  - Humanist: Garamond -> EB Garamond
  - Realist: Baskerville -> Libre Baskerville
  - Geometric: Bodoni -> Libre Bodoni
- Sans:
  - Humanist: Frutiger -> Hind
  - Realist: Helvetica -> Questrial, Roboto
  - Geometric: Futura -> Nunito

Text sizing:

- headings:
  - smaller line-spacing (1.3rem), smaller letter spacing (-5%)
  - not marked through size, but through color and
- copy text:
  - max-width: 700px
- relation between the two:
  - don't mix center-aligned with side-aligned
